# This is a fourth down model for NFL teams
### This uses nfl_data_py, and will contain all my work from start to end of this model
### My goals are, in no order:
[] See how the data is provided
[] Create a win probability model
[] Create a 4th down model
[] Be able to in live time see what my model suggests
